## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is an exploratory method that aims to capture the largest variance in a data set within a reduced number of 'principal components' (PCs). 

### Scree plot
A Scree plot summarises the percentage variance captures by each principal component.

```{r pca_scree_plot, echo=FALSE}
C = pca_scree_plot()
chart_plot(C,MS)
```

## PCA scores plots
PCA scores plots are presented here and coloured by factors that potentially account for any observed trends in the plot.

```{r pca_section,echo=FALSE}
C = pca_scores_plot(factor_name=S$factor_names[1])
chart_plot(C,MS)
```
